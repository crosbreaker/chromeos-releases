# Chrome OS Releases Database

This repo contains scripts for building a database of all Chrome OS recovery images. The generated data is located at the [chromeos-releases-data](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/chromeos-releases-data) repo, which is updated weekly. 

## Explanation

[Chrome OS recovery images](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595?hl=en) are used to reinstall or upgrade the operating system on Chromebooks. You can use them to repair a broken installation, or downgrade to older versions. Downgrading Chrome OS can allow for older bugs and vulnerabilities to be used, which is useful if you are trying to jailbreak the device. 

However, Google only makes the newest recovery images available, making it difficult to find older builds. To obtain a list of older recovery images as well as download links, we get this data from two sources:

- Historical data for recovery images is fetched from the [chrome-versions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-versions) NPM package. This old database used a convoluted method of brute forcing download URLs and is no longer kept up to date. 
- Newer data comes from parsing Internet Archive snapshots of the Chromium Serving Builds API. Snapshots are taken daily, so it includes the data for every single recovery image since 2024. 

## Building the Database

You need to run this on a Linux system, due to dependencies on `vboot-kernel-utils` and `binwalk`. 

To start, clone this repository, create a Python venv, and install dependencies:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Install `vboot-kernel-utils` (needed for the `futility` command) `busybox`, `pcregrep`, and `binwalk`:
```
sudo apt install vboot-kernel-utils busybox binwalk pcregrep
```

Run the script:

```
python3 main.py
```

Generated data will be located at `data/data.json`. Note that the script will download several TB of data on the first run to determine the kernel version for recovery images.
